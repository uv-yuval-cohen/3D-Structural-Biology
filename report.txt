methods:
we go on to talk about methods leading our project.encountaring such problem, we wanted to develop our way into completing our goal. first we started with the data set of 4000 protein, 
a substantaly large amount, especially when a seperation into peptides is needed. After pre processing the data, extracting the peptides in relation to the proteins, and classifing them 
by their true label (nes containment), we moved on to the evaluation. Our strategy was to advance our model with the evaluation of the data acccuracy. processing a substantial amount of the 
proteins, dividing into peptides, embedding them, getting a score and a prediction using a changing threshold and finally getting a classification accuracy. with that the goalmis to progress 
the model, involving a well connected new data of negative examples to train the data better, and then improving our accuracy, everything towards the final goal of predicting the 
20K proteins, whether they contain nes or not. our workflow is based on evaluation and learning into progression, giving us a good balance of testing and correcting.
